# Towards a day-1 precipitation product for GPM

This repository implements a day-1 precipitation (D1P) product prototype for the GPM constellation. The purpose of this prototype is to explore pathways toward the rapid integration of novel sensors into the data processing of the GPM constellation, allowing them to deliver precipitation estimates from the first day of data availability.
